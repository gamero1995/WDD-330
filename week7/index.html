        All functions have a length property that returns the number of parameters the function has.
        <br><br>
        There is nothing to stop you adding your own properties to functions in the same way that you can add properties
        to any object in JavaScript. <br>For example: you could add a description property to a function that describes
        what
        it does:<br>
        square.description = 'Squares a number that is provided as an argument'<br><br>

        An Immediately Invoked Function Expression – or IIFE – (pronounced 'iffy') is an anonymous function that, as the
        name suggests, is invoked as soon as it’s defined. This is easily achieved by placing parentheses at the end of
        the function definition (remember we use parentheses to invoke a function). The function also has to be made
        into an expression, which is done by placing the whole declaration inside parentheses
        <pre>
<code>
(function(){
    const temp = 'World';
    console.log(`Hello ${temp}`);
    })();
</code>
        </pre>

        APIS = An application programming interface (API) is a collection of methods that allows external access to
        another program or service <br><br>
        The Fetch API provides a global fetch() method that only has one mandatory argument, which is the URL of the
        resource you wish to fetch.
        <pre>
<code>
fetch('https://example.com/data')
  .then( // code that handles the response )
  .catch( // code that runs if the server returns 
              an er
</code>
        </pre>
        Although most of the time you will be dealing with a response object that is returned from a request you make,
        you can also create your own response objects using a constructor function:

        <pre>
<code>
const response = new Response( 'Hello!', {
ok: true,
status: 200,
statusText: 'OK',
type: 'cors',
url: '/api'
});
</code>
                    </pre>

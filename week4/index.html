        <p>Traditionally, when a form was submitted, it would be sent to a server where the information would be
            processed using a 'back end' language such as PHP or Ruby<br><br>
            Instead of using a numerical index, we can use the name attribute to identify a form: <br>

        <pre>
<code>
const form = document.forms['search'];
</code>
        </pre>

        We can also access the form controls using their 'name' attributes as if it was a property of the form object.
        So, for example, the input field has a name attribute of searchInput and can be accessed using this code:
        <pre>
<code>
    const input = form['searchInput']
</code>
        </pre>

        The focus event occurs when an element is focused on. In the case of an input element, this is when the cursor
        is placed inside the element (either by clicking or tapping on it or navigating to it using the keyboard).

        <pre>
<code>
    const input = form.elements.searchInput;
    input.addEventListener('focus', () => alert('focused'), false);
</code>
        </pre>

        <h2>Encapsulation</h2>
        When I use my juicer, I put the fruit into the machine, press the 'on' button and out comes the juice. I haven’t
        a clue how it does it—only that it makes a very loud noise! This demonstrates the concept of encapsulation: the
        inner workings are kept hidden inside the object and only the essential functionalities are exposed to the end
        user, such as the 'on' button. In OOP, this involves keeping all the programming logic inside an object and
        making methods available to implement the functionality, without the outside world needing to know how it’s
        done. <br><br>
        <h2>Polymorphism</h2>
        My juicer isn't the only appliance I own that has an 'on' button, although the way the on button works is
        slightly different for each appliance. My juicer also uses the same electrical outlet as other appliances in my
        kitchen. I can also place various types of fruit into it and it still juices them. These examples demonstrate
        the concept of polymorphism: the same process can be used for different objects. In OOP, this means various
        objects can share the same method, but also have the ability to override shared methods with a more specific
        implementation. <br><br>
        <h2>Inheritance</h2>
        I’d really like the next model up from my juicer, as it can deal with more types of fruit and it’s a bit
        quieter. Even though it has these extra features, I’m sure that inside it uses many of the same parts that my
        juicer has. This demonstrates the concept of inheritance: taking the features of one object then adding some new
        features. In OOP, this means we can take an object that already exists and inherit all its properties and
        methods. We can then improve on its functionality by adding new properties and methods.
